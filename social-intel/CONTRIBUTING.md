## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 style guidelines:

```python
# Good
def search_username(username: str) -> dict:
    """Search for username across platforms."""
    results = {}
    for platform in PLATFORMS:
        try:
            data = check_platform(platform, username)
            if data:
                results[platform] = data
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error checking {platform}: {e}")
    return results

# Bad
def searchUsername(username):
    results={}
    for p in PLATFORMS:
        try:
            data=check_platform(p,username)
            if data: results[p]=data
        except Exception as e: logger.error(f"Error checking {p}: {e}")
    return results
```

### Code Organization

- **Functions**: Clear, descriptive names with docstrings
- **Classes**: Follow single responsibility principle
- **Modules**: Logical grouping of related functionality
- **Imports**: Organized and minimal

### Documentation Standards

- **Docstrings**: Use Google or NumPy style
- **Comments**: Explain why, not what
- **README**: Keep updated with new features
- **Examples**: Provide clear usage examples

### Error Handling

```python
# Good
try:
    response = session.get(url, timeout=15)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
except requests.RequestException as e:
    logger.error(f"Request failed: {e}")
    return None
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid JSON response: {e}")
    return None

# Bad
response = session.get(url)
return response.json()
```
